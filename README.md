# FileManagerX

I re-invented the wheel during an internship.
This (not) good old file manager app could be implemented on some vintage Android 4.1 machines.<br>
The process of making taught me some about Java File stuff such as moving and copying a file to another folder.<br>
<br>
Took me a week to create this mess. Bugs are ready.
